### Day 0
It's night, I am just beginning to fork the repo for this journey. I might not be committed enough to do this since this challenge was publicly available 9 years ago, and everyone's basically a pro right now (even the discord is now a phising and spam wasteland), but hey, everyone starts somewhere...


### Day 1
I'm opening codedex react course at this day. Did my first chapter on creating social media post.
